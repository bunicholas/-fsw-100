                            <h1>Hollywood Sign</h1>
                            <span>December 14, 1923</span>
                            <p>(formerly the Hollywoodland Sign) is an American landmark and cultural icon overlooking Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. It is situated on Mount Lee, in the Hollywood Hills area of the Santa Monica Mountains. Spelled out in 45 ft (13.7 m)-tall white capital letters and 350 feet (106.7 m) long,[1] it was originally created in 1923 as a temporary advertisement for a local real estate development, but due to increasing recognition, the sign was left up.[2]

                                Among the most well-known landmarks in both California and the United States, the sign makes frequent appearances in popular culture, particularly in establishing shots for films and television programs set in or around Hollywood. Signs of similar style, but spelling different words, are frequently seen as parodies. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce holds trademark rights to the Hollywood Sign.[3]
                                
                                Because of its widespread recognizability and its visibility from many points across the Los Angeles Basin, the sign has been a frequent target of pranks and vandalism across the decades. It has since undergone restoration, including the installation of a security system to deter mischief. The sign is protected and promoted by nonprofit The Hollywood Sign Trust,[4] while its site and the surrounding land are part of Griffith Park.
                                
                                Visitors can hike to the sign from the Bronson Canyon entrance to Griffith Park or from Griffith Observatory.[5][6] There is also a trailhead near the Lake Hollywood Reservoir outside of Griffith Park, and although not an access point in itself, there is a popular scenic vista point around Lake Hollywood Park near the trailhead.[7]</p>
